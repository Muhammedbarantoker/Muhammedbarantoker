## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi my name is Muhammed Baran  
My journey into software development was not something I planned it was something life steered me toward and it turned out to be the best direction I could take

I was introduced to programming during my time at Fatih Vocational and Technical Anatolian High School Although I originally chose a different field circumstances led me into the IT department That unexpected switch became a turning point in my life

After graduation I spent several years searching for my path I explored different job opportunities but none of them felt quite right Eventually I found myself returning to software this time with intention motivation and genuine interest Looking back I am proud of that choice

My relationship with computers actually began much earlier I started using one at the age of six playing games in a family owned internet cafe That early curiosity evolved into a passion for building and problem solving through code

I started learning Python and quickly got hooked As I progressed through the fundamentals I developed a better understanding of logic and problem solving I am constantly learning experimenting and pushing forward

For me clean and human readable code is just as important as functionality I believe in writing code that both computers and people can understand

My interests include Python open source projects and core programming logic  
My goal is to keep learning keep building and keep improving
